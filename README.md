# I don't know!

A VsCode color theme, it's a really dark theme with hints of green similar to WhatsApp, also blue and purple.

Why did I name theme "I don't know", it's simple!

Whenever someone asks you what VsCode theme you're using... You can give them your biggest bestest smerk you can possibly conjure up and say... I. DON'T. KNOW.



That's it, that is literally it. I just wanted to make that joke, that's why I went through the trouble of making the whole VsCode theme in the first place.
To be fair the theme itself looks really nice as well.
